# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

<!-- Maintainers: the `## [<version>]` section is extracted verbatim and published
     as the Codeberg release body (see `.forgejo/workflows/release.yml`), so keep
     it user-facing and up to date — never place maintainer notes inside a
     version section. The release checklist is in `docs/release.md`. -->

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1] - 2026-09-23

First public release.

### Added

- **Instances.** Add, edit, remove and test multiple Forgejo/Codeberg instances;
  tokens live in VS Code SecretStorage, and the instance list can be exported or
  imported (optionally password-encrypted) with conflict detection for duplicate
  URLs and tokens.
- **Dashboard.** Repository, Issue and Pull Request tabs grouped by instance,
  with the Issue/PR tabs scoped to the current account; repository cards show the
  default branch, stars, forks plus browser/copy actions, and a linked-repository
  card covers the repository of the current workspace.
- **Repository browsing.** README preview through VS Code's Markdown preview,
  recent commits, branch/tag/Release lists with create and delete, and a file
  browser with directory tree, file search, single-file history and a diff
  viewer.
- **Issues and pull requests.** List, detail, create, edit, close/reopen and
  delete, comments with attachments, Markdown rendering with mentions, and
  reactions, subscriptions, time tracking and dependency management on the detail
  page. The detail page also shows merge status with its blockers and the CI
  status checks, and offers merge (merge/squash/rebase) and revert-merge.
- **Pull request review.** Inline review comments in VS Code's native diff
  editor, including multi-line comments, with a dedicated editor panel for rich
  comments (Markdown toolbar, preview, `@`/`#` completion, image upload) and a
  comment / approve / request-changes conclusion when submitting.
- **Pull request worktrees.** Open a PR in a worktree created from
  `refs/pull/<n>/head`, with a configurable open mode and cache directory,
  worktree management in the settings view, and a confirmation before local
  commits or changes are discarded.
- **Editor integration.** Comment on diff lines, create issues from `TODO`/
  `FIXME` comments with a permanent source link, start work on an issue in a
  dedicated worktree, and a status bar entry that pushes the current branch on
  demand and opens the create-PR dialog.
- **Notifications and search.** Notification centre with unread badge, status and
  type filters and single/all mark-as-read, background polling with desktop
  notifications, global repository/Issue/PR search across instances, and keyword
  filtering in repository lists.
- **Actions.** Workflow run history with incremental paging, run detail with
  jobs, logs and artifacts, artifact download, cancellation of a running run, and
  manual workflow dispatch with inputs.
- **MCP server.** The first configured instance with a stored access token is
  exposed to MCP clients
  (VS Code ≥ 1.102) as a read-only stdio server covering Issues, PRs,
  notifications, repositories, search, Actions, files, commits, reviews and
  metadata, with input validation and result truncation. The token travels
  through the child's environment and never appears in schemas, results or logs.
- **Settings and localization.** Language switch, debug logging to the
  "Forgejo Toolkit" output channel, worktree configuration, and English/Chinese
  localization for the webview, the extension manifest and the packaged README.
- **Engineering.** Kubb-generated API client shipped as source, a shared request
  client, MSW-based mocks for offline development, oxlint/oxfmt, vue-tsc with
  strict templates, and a human-triggered Forgejo CI plus a release workflow that
  validates the commit, packages the extension and optionally creates the
  Codeberg release with the `.vsix` attached.
