# Known Issues

## Pull Request attachments are fetched from the Issue API

Forgejo's `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{index}` endpoint does **not** return the `assets`/`attachments` field, even though the web UI shows them. However, the underlying PR is also accessible as an issue via `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{index}`, and that endpoint **does** return `assets`.

To display PR attachments in the detail view, `ForgejoClient.getPullRequestDetail` currently makes both requests and merges the `assets` array from the issue response into the PR detail. This is a workaround and may break if Forgejo changes the relationship between PRs and issues in the future.

Ideally, Forgejo would include `assets` directly in the pull request response, or expose a dedicated attachments endpoint for pull requests.

## Image attachments in Markdown require extension-host proxying

Forgejo attachment URLs (e.g. `/attachments/{uuid}`) require authentication. The VS Code webview cannot share cookies with the extension host, so `<img>` tags pointing directly at Forgejo are redirected to the login page and fail to render.

The extension works around this by fetching each image in the rendered Markdown HTML using the stored access token, converting it to a `data:` URL, and replacing the original `src` before returning the HTML to the webview.
